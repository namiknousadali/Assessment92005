        <h2>Rainfall</h2>
 Most cities receive between 618 mm or 24.3 in (as in Christchurch) and 1,317 mm or 51.9 in (Whangārei) of precipitation annually.[2] Rainfall is distributed uniformly throughout the year in most parts of the country, especially in the South Island. Northern and eastern parts of the country, including Auckland, Christchurch and Wellington see a slight winter maximum consistent with a Mediterranean climate. Summer and autumn maxima can be found in places closer to the southwest, such as Invercargill and Milford Sound.

How much rain a place receives is highly dependent on topography. The Southern Alps, the North Island Volcanic Plateau and surrounding ranges can produce large variation in rainfalls in places barely tens of kilometres apart. Milford Sound receives over 6,700 mm (264 Inches) of the rainfall a year on average while barely 100 km (62 Miles) away Alexandra in Central Otago receives only slightly greater than 300 mm annually, giving it a borderline oceanic/semi-arid climate.[3] Air laden with water vapour from the ocean is pushed from the west in response to Earth's rotation. This weather circulates the southern seas largely unimpeded by land until it reaches the Southern Alps. The humid westerly wind is forced up over the mountains, at cooler elevation water condenses and falls as snow or rain. This orographic rain explains the huge difference in conditions between the wet west and dry east of the South Island.[4] The drier föhn wind descending the eastern slopes of the Southern Alps gives rise to a distinctive local weather phenomenon, the Nor'west arch, visible in much of Canterbury and parts of Otago.
